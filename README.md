# Virtual market place database

Designed a virtual market place database and storefront for digital and physical products, with a focus on customer preferences and efficient logistics.
This database not only manages order processing, but also can be queried to find patterns in the data, such as customer preferences, items commonly purchased together, and shipping bottlenecks.
